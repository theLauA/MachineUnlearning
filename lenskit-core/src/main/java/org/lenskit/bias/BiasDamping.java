/**
 * Damping parameter for bias models.
 *
 * <p>
 * The smoothing enabled by this parameter is based on <a
 * href="http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html">FunkSVD</a>. The idea
 * is to bias item or user means towards the global mean based on how many items
 * or users are involved. So, if the global mean is \\(\mu\\) and smoothing \\(\gamma\\),
 * the mean of some values is \\[\frac{\gamma\mu + \sum r}{\gamma + n}\\]
